<i><h1>Gabby's Life</h1></i>
<section>

<b><h2><span class="red">Gabby's</span> Past</h2></b>
<p>Gabby was born in Syracuse, New York  on February 23, 2001 and lived
there until she was 14 years old. She moved to Greenville because her
dad had the option to move anywhere in the country, and chose here based
on a recommendation. Gabby went to St. Margaret’s Elementary (pre-k3 - 6),
then <a href="http://bishopgrimes.org/" target="_blank">Bishop Grimes JR/SR Prep</a> for 7th and 8th grade. She played varsity
tennis at both Bishop Grimes and Mann. Mann is the first public school
that she has been to.</p>

<b><h2><span class="red">Gabby's</span> Present</h2></b>

<p>Gabby’s family consists of her dad, mom, older brother Jordon, younger brother
 Ashton, and a cat and dog. She has played tennis since she was in 3rd grade,
  and is still playing today. She has been playing on varsity since 7th grade.
  Gabby is currently a junior in <a href="https://www.greenville.k12.sc.us/jlmann/" target="_blank">high school</a>, her brother Ashton is a sophomore,
   and her brother Jordon is working in New York. We visit New York often throughout
    the year to visit family and friends. </p>
	<p>For her, visiting New York is a good and bad thing. It is mostly a good thing because she
  gets to see her family and friends. It is only a bad thing when she has to
   leave because there will be a long period of time before they'll be able to see them again.
    Everytime Gabby goes to New York, she stays at her friend Machaela’s house
     because that is like her second family. She will walk into her house and just
     wait for them to come home and surprise them. It honestly is the best feeling
      in the world for her.</p>

<b><h2><span class="red">Gabby's</span> Future</h2></b>

<p>After college, Gabby has no idea what she wants to do as a career, but
  she is considering doing something with psychology. She is looking to go
   to college somewhere in SC, or she might wait a year and move back to New
York and go to college there. Gabby is indecisive and is a type of person who likes to live in
the moment, so she won’t officially know until her senior year. She wants
to stay close to her family, but she also wants to be a good distance away so
she can prove her independence. Gabby is a very realistic person, especially when
it comes to money, so she isn’t expecting to be rich, but is expecting to be successful.
